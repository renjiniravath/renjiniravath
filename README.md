- 👋 Hi, I’m @renjiniravath
- 👀 I am interested in full stack development. I believe that I'm a generalist who doesn't feel restricted by any specific programming language, but to the system design. My way of approaching problems would be looking through documentations and simillar use cases.
- :lady_beetle: Although a generalist, I am experienced in working with Javascript, Node.js, Golang, Java, REST APIs, message queues, AWS, SQL, Redis, React.js and MongoDB to name a few that I'm really confident in.
- :man_student:	 I graduated from Master of Computer Science from North Carolina State University in May 2023.
- :man_technologist:	My career in Computer Science started with an amazing 3 year stinct at https://hifx.in/ where I found out my passion. Last summer, I interned at Amazon as Software Development Engineer Intern where I had a great time!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on back end heavy projects, that's where my heart lies.
- 📫 Reach me out on mail at renjiniravath@gmail.com and on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/renji-joseph-sabu/
