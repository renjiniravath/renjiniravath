- 👋 Hi, I’m @renjiniravath
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development. I believe that I'm a generalist who doesn't feel attached to any specific programming language, but to the system design. My way of approaching problems would be looking through documentations and simillar use cases.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at North Carolina State University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on back end heavy projects, that's where my heart stays.
- 📫 Reach me out on mail at renjiniravath@gmail.com and on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/renji-joseph-sabu/
